# Car Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes car sales data to extract insights on sales trends, model performance, dealership profitability, and customer sentiment. The analysis is divided into two parts: one done through Excel using pivot tables and visualizations, and the other through a dashboard built using IBM Cognos Analytics.

## Project Structure

### Excel Sheets:
- **CarSales**: Raw sales data including year, month, model, dealer ID, quantity sold, and profit.
- **Dealer_Quantity_Summary**: Summarizes the total quantity sold by dealer.
- **Model_Profit_By_Date**: Tracks profit generated by each car model over time.
- **Dealer_Profit_Summary_2018-2019**: Summary of dealer profits for 2018 and 2019.
- **Model_Profit_By_Dealer**: Breaks down profit for individual car models across different dealerships.

### Cognos Analytics Dashboard:
- **Sales Performance**: Displays total profit, quantity sold, and profit by dealer ID.
- **Service Insights**: Includes recalls by model, affected systems, and a sentiment analysis based on customer feedback.
